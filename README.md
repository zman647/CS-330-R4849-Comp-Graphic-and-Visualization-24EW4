How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software with an attempt to make code that is well organized and noted. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project showed me how to create objects, shaders, and apply textures from functions that were provided for me. Essentially, I was given a huge code template that was well formulated. This is often a practice within code as you will not always be working from scratch, meaning that you will have to analyze and improve/finish code given to you.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process I followed was mostly a function by function appraoch. I started with finishing objectMaterials to then using setupSceneLighting. I try to work in one function at a time, maybe two at the most. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

These tactics could be used to keep progress going and to understand where I left off / where I currently am. This helps me keep a visual idea of what needs to get done instead of trying to code everything at once.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach developing programs by understanding the requirements first. This is necessary and important as this will base the rest of someones work. Then, you have to Plan, Design, Implement, and Test.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

For this, we used a modular design. A code template was created for us with a lot of empty pieces which we then used to create a functioning piece of code. 

How did iteration factor into your development?

I had to refine code, and continue to build upon it. This included testing and debugging very often to be sure that the code was working correctly.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Originially, it felt as if I was only working and focused on an individual function. As it got more complex, I had to refer to more parts of the code and utilize more information at once to be capable of creating more complex parts.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science allows me to reach my goals by teaching me multiple problem solving skills involving software. An understanding of technology is necessary to be able to accomplish something like creating a rendered scene. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

This class taught me to work with very complex graphical templates and how to create objects, lighting, and more.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

The biggest takeaway from this class is general C++ software knowledge. This was a complex program that used many aspects and fucntions of C++, which is a very popular and widely used language.
